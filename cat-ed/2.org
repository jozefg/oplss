Proof-Irrelevance out of Exluded-Middle and Choice in the Calculus of
Constructions.

i : (N, +, 0) ↪ (Z, +, 0)
i = n ↦ n

WTS if f, g : Z → M if i · f  = i · g then f = g


If n ≥ 0 then f(n) = g(n). What if n < 0? Then 0 = f(0) = f(-n + n) so

       0 = f(-n) + f(n) similarly for g

Therefore, f(n) and g(n) are always invertible.

0 = 0
0 = g(-n) + g(n)
0 = g(-n) + f(n)
f(-n) + f(n) = g(-n) + f(n)
f(-n) + f(n) + f(-n) = g(-n) + f(n) + f(-n)
f(-n) = g(-n)

f(-n) + f(n) = 0




Categorical axiom of choice: Every epimorphism is a split epi.

If s · r = id then s is a section of r and r is a retraction of s

Being a split monic = having a retraction
Being a split epic  = having a section

Lemma, if f has a section s and a retraction r then s = r, ie if  s ·
f = id and f · r = id then s = r

s · f · r = (s · f) · r = id · r = r
s · f · r = s · (f · r) = s · id = s

Therefore s = r as required.

If an arrow f a section and an retraction, g, then g has retraction
and section f. Immediate by defn.
