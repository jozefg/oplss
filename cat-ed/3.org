* Initial/Terminal Objects

A terminal object is an object 1 so that for any object X there is a
unique map ! : X → 1.

Corollary: 1 has only one endomorphism, the identity.

Lemma, 1 is unique up to iso.

Assume X is another terminal object, then ! : X → 1 and x : 1 → X are
uniquely defined. However ! · x = id and x · 1 = id by
corollary. Therefore, x and ! are two sided inverses and 1 ≅ X as
required.

Dual of a terminal object is an initial one. An initial object is the
terminal object in the opposite category. Denote the uniquely defined
map in the normal category as ¡

Note, i · ! = ! for all i since the set C(X, 1) has only one member !
and i · !, ! ∈ C(X, 1).
