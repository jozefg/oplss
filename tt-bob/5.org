#+TITLE: Type Theory 5

* Recap

We were looking at the Id type. J is still confusing, it's just
induction.


     Γ ⊢ a : M = N    Γ, a : A ⊢ B : P(a, a, refl)
     —————————————————————————————————————————————
              Γ ⊢ J(B)(a)  : P(M, N, a)


Special case: transport

    transport : M ≡ N → P M → P N
    transport = J(λx. x)

Transport is an isomorphism up to a higher isomorphism! It's a way of
saying that we can translate from one fiber to another fiber that when
acting on reflexivity acts as the identity function.

Derived notion:

suppose P =ₐ Q where P : B(M) and Q(N) if a : M = N. P =ₐ Q means that
tr(a)(M) = N

This is a nice notion of heterogeneous equality.

Identification is an equivalence: namely

refl(M) : M = M
a⁻ : N = M [a : M = N]
trans(a, b) : N = P [a : N = M, b : M = P]

EXERCISE: complete these
